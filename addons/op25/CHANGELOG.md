# Changelog

## 0.0.2

First image published to GHCR. Same content as 0.0.1, which never built: its
tag disagreed with the manifest version and the manifest tripped the add-on
linter.

## 0.0.1

Initial release. Experimental — not yet verified on real hardware.

- OP25 multi_rx with the React web UI, served through Home Assistant ingress
  and on port 8099.
- RTL-SDR via `usb: true`; Debian trixie's librtlsdr 2.0.2 supports the
  RTL-SDR Blog V4 without a patched build.
- Config comes from a JSON file in the add-on's config directory; add-on
  options cover only the things that change with hardware or credentials.
- Speech-to-text can use the Supervisor proxy, so no long-lived token.
